It focuses on surveying the major events that have shaped the international system, tracking the significant power shifts that have occurred during each period, and the theories that have been developed in response to this changing context. Topics include: the World Wars; post-War II construction of global institutions; the Cold War; decolonisation; post-Cold War globalisation; the 'war on terror'; humanitarian intervention; the Great Recession; and American decline and rising powers. Students will gain a comprehensive overview of the historical debates that have shaped the discipline of IR and an appreciation of the historical roots of contemporary international politics.",,INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY,"This subject explores the main issues of political economy in international relations. Over the past few decades, as nation-states have found it increasingly difficult to manage sprawling networks of global interdependence, states have become part of broader governance networks that include relations with a variety of nonstate, international and supranational actors. Not surprisingly, these changes have provoked controversies about the supposed benefits and harms of globalisation, and raise important questions about whose interests are served by the contemporary global economy. This subject explores debates about globalisation, focussing on understanding global governance and conceptualising the role of nation-states and other actors in the contemporary global economy. We also take a look at the nature and extent of regionalisation, the politics of trade and finance, and the implications for governance at the state and global levels. Finally, we address the main ethical challenges in the contemporary global economy, focussing on the problems of poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation.",,SECURITY IN A BORDERLESS WORLD,"The intensification of global interaction is challenging the centrality of the state in international affairs. New forms of association are changing the way states and communities interact. Simultaneously security agendas have broadened. So called 'old wars' between states appear on the wane, replaced by 'new wars', with the 'war on terror' framing the state security agenda. However, these shifts may be more apparent than real and demand critical evaluation. We will examine the significance of these trends for security, understood both in its traditional military sense, and also in its less conventional sense as human or environmental security. Issues explored include terrorism, unregulated population flows, transnational crime, pandemics (notably HIV/AIDS), and the environment.",,INTERNATIONAL SECURITY IN THE INDO-PACIFIC REGION,"This subject explores the international politics of the Indo-Pacific region and focuses particularly on questions of international security and strategy through the lens of the Indo-Pacific's contested strategic geographic spaces.

It examines the historical, ideological, institutional and political contexts in which foreign policy decisions are made in Australia, and the consequences of those decisions for key policy priorities. We begin with an introduction to Australian foreign policymaking institutions, including the role of the executive, bureaucracy, parliament, media and other non-state actors. We then introduce students to diverse International Relations perspectives on foreign policymaking, along with Australia's unique strategic culture (the specific historical and structural factors that have shaped government decision-making in Australia). We conclude with an analysis of key policy case studies, such as the alliance with the US, managing the rise of China, development cooperation, and asylum seeker policy. This subject is suitable for all Masters students who want to work in or understand Australia's political and policy-making environment.",,COMMUNICATION THEORY AND ANALYSIS,"In general terms, as full a spectrum as possible of communication and public relations theory will be taught in this subject. These include theories of relationships, theories of communication, theories of social influence and received response and theories and models of practice. One of central ideas behind the subject is that practitioners inform their work with both an understanding of theoretical concepts and research practices and principles. This follows the ideas expressed by Cornelissen (2000) who see strong advantages in practitioners being more reflective rather than intuitive. Modern society demands an integrated approach to managing communication. It looks more to the use of theory, rather than a traditional problem solving approach to issues and problems. It believes that practitioners who are constantly reviewing and questioning their practice, in the end provide superior service and can also provide a more sophisticated interpretation of events in a period of change.",,STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION AGENCY B,"Strategic Communication Agency B is an extension of the first semester STC3SAA Strategic Communication Agency A.

A member of the academic staff acting in the capacity of industry based learning coordinator liaises with the placement provider to formulate and structure a program of learning for each student. This program is normally project based, with day-to-day supervision by the placement provider. Progress is monitored at regular intervals.",,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN BIOINFORMATICS,,,BIOINFORMATICS,,,ANALYSIS OF REPEATED MEASURES,,,SPATIAL ANALYSIS,,,THEORY OF STATISTICS,"This subject builds on the knowledge of classical statistical inference developed in STM3SI (Statistical Inference). You will be introduced to proofs of some fundamental results in the advanced theory of statistical inference, including principles of data reduction, point estimation, hypothesis testing, interval estimation, asymptotic evaluations and the effect of model selection on confidence intervals. Some of these proofs are presented by the teacher in lectures and some of these proofs are derived independently by the you as parts of your assignments. In addition, the subject introduces you to some important practical applications of advanced theory of statistical inference. This is achieved both by the teacher describing these applications in lectures and you discovering these applications through carrying out your assignments.",,REAL-TIME AND FAULT-TOLERANT SYSTEMS,"This subject examines the concept of fault, error, failure, layered machines, classification of faults, provision of static and dynamic redundancy, hardware, software, time, information and network redundancy, N-version and roll-back recovery methods, concepts of local and global clocks, time validity of information in real time systems and networks.",,IMAGE PROCESSING,"This subject covers both fundamentals of image processing as well as computing techniques with applications in many cutting-edge domains such as image recognition, object detection and segmentation, image registration and retrieval. Design issues on image recognition will be addressed, which contain eigenface technology, image feature extraction, similarity measure, and performance evaluation. Practice on image recognition will be offered in Labs. .",,EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RESEARCH METHODS,,,HEALTH DATA ANALYSIS A,,,"COMPLEXITY, CRYPTOGRAPHY AND COMPRESSION","In this subject students will develop the mathematical basis for cryptography and compression. A variety of specific methods of encryption and data compression will be learnt, including examples of historical relevance and examples of current usage in information transfer and storage. A number of underlying mathematical concepts will be encountered, including an introduction to computational complexity and randomness.",,DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS,,,ADVANCED DATABASES,"This subject responds to three contemporary issues: data volume is increasing and information requirements have become very complex; Object-Oriented Conceptual modelling is increasingly popular in software design, particularly for database modelling; and integration of web, databases and data warehouse technologies is needed. You will learn advanced database skills to address these issues, including Object-Relational Databases, Data Warehouse analysis and the integration of Data Warehouse with business intelligence tools.",,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN BIOINFORMATICS,,,DATA WAREHOUSE CONCEPTS AND DESIGN,,,ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES (PG),,,EPIDEMIOLOGY 1,"This subject provides you with an introduction to epidemiological methods and theory. At the completion of this subject, you will be able to explain the methods and applications of descriptive and analytical epidemiology, explain the uses of different epidemiological study designs, understand the effect of bias, chance and confounding on epidemiological studies, and critically appraise published epidemiological studies. You will understand the role of epidemiology in supporting public health activities and will be introduced to some of the practical applications of epidemiology.",,METHODS IN GIS,"Geographic Information Systems are an essential tool allowing spatial and temporal components to be added, visualised and modelled for any data, be it research, business, or even personal (e.g. tagging photos). It is indispensable in academic research and can be applied directly to plot past and current trends, and to provide the basis for extrapolating future trends. In this subject the key concepts and techniques are introduced, including the design of appropriate databases and their manipulation using GIS software (ESRI ArcGIS). Case-studies will be drawn from a wide variety of fields such as ecological, archaeological, geological and applications in research and planning, providing a broad knowledge base and skills set in GIS.",,VISUAL ANALYTICS,"As data becomes ever more complex to analyse, the need for tools to help integrate the user's knowledge and inference capability into the analytical process becomes important. In analytics, this is generally referred to as visualisation, which this subject will cover in detail from various perspectives, for example, temporal, spatial, spatial-temporal, multi-variate, text/documents, graphs and networks, and more. These perspectives will be covered with various business applications in mind including, statistical and summary reporting, trends spotting and projections, process capture, and real-time reporting. These applications will be discussed with reference to various visual analytics frameworks and theories as well as case examples.",
