Project scope management is defined as the processes required to ensure that the project includes all the work required and only the work required, to complete the project by successfully meeting stakeholders needs. When scoping projects, it is vital to define the need for them. This is typically done at the project start up/initiation stages at a high level relating the projects intended benefits to the organisation's strategic intent and in more detail during the later stages. In some cases, the operational concept may exist before the need to undertake the project has been realised.

Procurement management focuses on that part of the project's scope of work or materials that will be bought from another organisation, either as a result of company alliance arrangements, or most often resulting from contracting or subcontracting. Purchased work packages undertaken by another firm must be well defined and managed with great care, or disputes, claims, and project delays will arise, impacting cost, schedule, and ultimately project success. As many projects require the procurement of materials, the imperatives of supply chain management are explored. Project procurement creates a legal relationship and thus there is an understanding requirement of the basics of contract law.",,MAN6302 - Managing Project Quality,"Project quality management describes the processes required to ensure that the project will satisfy the needs for which it was undertaken. There are three phases in this process: quality planning which includes identifying which quality standards are relevant to the project, determining how to satisfy them and how and when they'll be measured; quality assurance which involves periodic evaluation to ensure that project inputs and outcomes will satisfy the relevant quality standards; and, quality control which involves monitoring specific project results to ensure that they comply with the relevant quality standards while identifying ways to improve both product and process. Achieving planned levels of quality requires effective communication between team members and other stakeholders.

This unit is designed to enable students gain a logical and conceptual understanding of project risk and its evaluation and management within the context of modern project-oriented organisations.",,MAN6304 - Project Leadership,"Project management and leadership are interlinked, but some project managers pay too much attention to managing and spend too little time leading. The reality is that both are necessary, but alone each is not sufficient. How the leading or managing is done shapes the attribution of how effective the project manager is seen to be. Many aspects of managing and leading can be viewed as processes, and these can be learnt. This unit will explore how this can be done, and will guide students toward becoming better at both project management and project leadership.

Students will demonstrate cross-cultural awareness, including cultural competence necessary to effectively manage. Particular emphasis is placed on the application of theory to matters that may confront managers today and into the future.",,MAN5401 - Managing Project Scope and Stakeholders,"Successfully managing project stakeholders, scope and communications is crucial to effective project management. Project scope management is defined as the processes required to ensure that the project includes all the work required and only the work required, to complete the project by successfully meeting stakeholders needs. When scoping projects, it is vital to define the need for them. This is typically done at the project start up/initiation stages at a high level relating the projects intended benefits to the organisation's strategic intent and in more detail during the later stages. In some cases, the operational concept may exist before the need to undertake the project has been realised. Throughout the life of the project, successful scope management is intertwined with managing the various stakeholders in the project and the communications with them. This unit examines the processes, resources and techniques to effectively manage project stakeholders, scope and communications.",,MAN5402 - Project Scheduling and Control,"The unit will focus on the integrated management of time and cost for effective and efficient delivery of projects. The unit will examine the importance of balancing the triple constraint of scope, time and cost in order to effectively plan, execute and monitor and control projects. The unit will be practical in focus aiming to develop dynamic scheduling techniques for time and cost that ensure discipline in planning as well as flexibility. Suitable industry standard scheduling tools will be used. Critical chain project management will be introduced to provide a means to critique traditional critical path methods.

In this unit, students examine the options a firm may have to create value, and apply the economic, accounting and financial techniques used to evaluate the impact of those options on the firm's financial performance. These techniques enable managers to view decisions from a number of perspectives that allow them to understand their business and the risks it faces in its economic environment. Students apply innovation and creativity to identify, plan, develop and strategically manage sustainable growth in a business.",,MAN5410 - Project Integration and Procurement Management,"The aim of this unit is to provide an in-depth understanding of project integration and procurement management to meet stakeholder objectives. Students explore the principle of integrating the major elements of project management to control projects from charter to closure. The emphasis is the development, monitoring and control of projects in support of both project and organisational value. Procurement management focuses on that part of the project's scope of work or materials that will be bought from another organisation, either as a result of company alliance arrangements, or most often resulting from contracting or subcontracting. Purchased work packages undertaken by another firm must be well defined and managed with great care, or disputes, claims, and project delays will arise, impacting cost, schedule, and ultimately project success. As many projects require the procurement of materials, the imperatives of supply chain management are explored. Project procurement creates a legal relationship and thus there is an understanding requirement of the basics of contract law.",,MAN6302 - Managing Project Quality,"Project quality management describes the processes required to ensure that the project will satisfy the needs for which it was undertaken. There are three phases in this process: quality planning which includes identifying which quality standards are relevant to the project, determining how to satisfy them and how and when they'll be measured; quality assurance which involves periodic evaluation to ensure that project inputs and outcomes will satisfy the relevant quality standards; and, quality control which involves monitoring specific project results to ensure that they comply with the relevant quality standards while identifying ways to improve both product and process. Achieving planned levels of quality requires effective communication between team members and other stakeholders. Skills in managing relationships are critical in achieving stakeholder satisfaction through all stages of the project. This unit teaches the technical and soft skills required for managing project quality and provides students with an opportunity to discover how these skills are used in the workplace.",,MAN6301 - Project Risk Management,"Project risk management is one of the most vital areas of project management. The existence of risk introduces various opportunities for projects to be compromised but also to be exploited for competitive advantages. This has become important in organisations that are project-based and in which project risk activities are integrated with business strategy. Project managers are therefore increasingly focusing their attention on risk identification and management, not only to prevent project failure, but also to generate business success. This unit is designed to enable students gain a logical and conceptual understanding of project risk and its evaluation and management within the context of modern project-oriented organisations.",,MAN6304 - Project Leadership,"Project management and leadership are interlinked, but some project managers pay too much attention to managing and spend too little time leading. The reality is that both are necessary, but alone each is not sufficient. How the leading or managing is done shapes the attribution of how effective the project manager is seen to be. Many aspects of managing and leading can be viewed as processes, and these can be learnt. This unit will explore how this can be done, and will guide students toward becoming better at both project management and project leadership. We examine theories of leadership and basic workplace psychology, and focus on skills for self-management, effective team-work and the development of your future skills.",,MAN5901 - Information Systems Challenges in Management,"Increasingly high demands are made on business managers to develop process and product innovations in rapidly changing, global markets. There is a considerable range of strategic responses which may improve operational effectiveness and address threats and opportunities in the global business environment.
