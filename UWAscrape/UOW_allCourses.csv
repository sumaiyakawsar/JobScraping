The Creative Industries is one of the fastest-growing, most dynamic sectors in the world. In the digital age, writing is becoming more and more central to the way we communicate with each other. The Bachelor of Creative Arts (Creative Writing) teaches skills and strategies so your writing is strong and clear. It helps you express ideas in imaginative ways that will impact your readers. Creative writers work in a range of areas: poetry, editing, writing for multimedia, commercial and content writing, commercial theatre and performance, short stories and novels, or even in ways that combine or challenge these forms. Creative writers might write to entertain or to educate – but they’re always drawing on the human condition, exploring what it means to be human. This course is designed to teach you to think about your story, image and scene. Creative writers draft and re-draft so their work is at its best, and this process is exciting.What you will study Core subjects will teach you the foundation for editing, writing across borders, genre and form, contemporary theory and research practice and you will explore social justice and children's literature.  You will work on a major project that will allow you to develop a significant piece of creative content on completion of your degree. Various artist and writer-in-residence programs take place throughout your degree and you will be encouraged to participate in extracurricular activities, facilitate public readings, perform your written work and pursue publication. There are opportunities to combine writing genres and explore the intersections between writing and other creative disciplines.",Global Communications Digital Publishing Media Strategy and Planning Public Relations Copywriter Market Research Event Coordinator Publicity Officer Tourism Officer Print/Television/Radio/Photo/Online Journalist Government Editor Feature Writer Reporter Researcher Advertising Social Media Manager Media Management Advisor Communication Specialist Corporate Communications Content Development,Australia,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,"Why choose this course  Studying creative arts at UOW means you get the right balance of practical and theoretical subjects and you get to design your own degree to meet your career aspirations.
