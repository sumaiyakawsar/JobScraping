At MADA we advocate a higher purpose for design that adds value beyond the aesthetic; to make contributions that are significant culturally, economically, environmentally and socially. The Master of Design (by Research) positions designers as the leaders of change. This course is offered in the principal research areas of communication design and industrial design, with focus on human-centred product design, transport design, digital design, new media, interaction design, experience design and interior architecture. The course requires students to develop a research project that leads to the production of a new body of creative design work with accompanying written and visual commentary that outlines the development of the project and its findings, and provides a critical context within which the work may be understood and valuated. The written component will be between 10,000 and 20,000 words, along with a visual record of the design process and creative outcomes. Written work is not examined separately but critically assessed together with an exhibition of design works. To support the development of the research project, students also undertake two coursework units in research methods, which will assist them with forming appropriate research design for their particular project.Through their research, identification and application of appropriate research and creative methodologies, master's graduates have demonstrated advanced skills and application of specialist knowledge to the attainment of practice-based design-focused outcomes.

The course aims to develop graduates with the therapeutic skills involved in educational and developmental psychology. Students develop high professional standards in the administration and interpretation of a comprehensive range of psychological, educational and developmental tests and assessments, and the planning, implementation and evaluation of evidence based interventions with individuals and groups.This program combines the coursework and practicum requirements of the Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC) accredited Master of Psychology (Educational and Developmental) degree with the thesis requirements of the PhD program.Only students currently enrolled in the Master of Psychology (Educational and Developmental) at Monash University can apply for the combined PhD program. Students must achieve specific requirements in that program before they will be invited to apply for the Master of Psychology (Educational and Developmental)/PhD.Students begin by undertaking coursework units of the Master of Psychology (Educational and Developmental) degree (at least one unit of which involves a research project), while also preparing their research proposal for the PhD. Continuation to the PhD program is granted if performance on all components meets the required academic standard. A wide variety of thesis topics related to educational and developmental psychology across the lifespan are possible, subject to available supervision. On completion of the course, students submit a PhD thesis of 80,000 to 100,000 words.Graduates will develop as independent specialist professionals with a commitment to learning across the lifespan of the theoretical, research, assessment, and therapeutic skills involved in educational and developmental psychology.",Australia,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
