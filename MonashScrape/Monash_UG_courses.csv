Science also increasingly relies on computing in collecting, storing and analysing large volumes of data such as computationally intensive simulations of new physical phenomena.This double degree course will provide you with a highly transferable set of skills and knowledge. It develops your scientific thinking skills, including critical analysis and problem-solving ability, and adds computational and complex IT skills, maximising opportunities for employment related to information technology and science.This course leads to two separate degrees:the Bachelor of Science,and depending upon your specialisation,the Bachelor of Computer Science orthe Bachelor of Computer Science in Data Science.You will gain all the benefits of each degree course (see Bachelor of Science/Bachelor of Computer Science) and be fully equipped to pursue a career in either field separately or to combine the two in your chosen work.You will be presented with some very exciting career choices. Depending on what area of science you chose to specialise in your career options could include geodynamics, meteorology, environmental and 3-D modelling, artificial intelligence, bioinformatics and biocomputing, cryptography, robotics, financial and statistical analysis and modelling, biomedical computing, and any field where scientific data management (storage, analysis, manipulation and presentation) is important.Show more",Australia,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This course has the potential to open many options and making the most of scientific and/or musical talents.Though you may not think that music and science go together, there is a wonderful synergy between the passion for creating music and a love of scientific knowledge.  Choosing between the two can be hard so why not make the most of your talents and study both science and music in a double degree course.With this course, your knowledge of human biology may help you unravel the physiological response that music creates. Your knowledge of physics or mathematics could help you create great music, perhaps as you specialise in creative music technology.This course leads to two separate degrees:Bachelor of ScienceBachelor of MusicYou will gain all the benefits of each degree course (see Bachelor of Science/Bachelor of Music) and be fully equipped to pursue a career in either field separately or to combine the two in your chosen work. Physics, mathematics and music have been related for millennia in the art and science of acoustics but the links are much more extensive. The latest developments in physics, psychology, human biology, materials science, information science and statistical analysis all give us new answers to ancient questions about music - what it is, why we make it, how we make it, why we listen to it and how it is changing. Whether your music specialisation is in Performance, Composition, and Creative music technology or Popular music, a broad understanding of science will illuminate and enrich the experience.And if your main focus is science, music expertise will offer interesting opportunities not available to everyone - perhaps working on treatments for auditory conditions or mapping sound to interaction.The research into the possibilities of music is also ongoing and creating new jobs dedicated to the many effects of music, music perception or the performance and technical underpinnings of instruments. Alternatively you could combine your knowledge of physics, mathematics and computing to become a sound engineer.Show more",Australia,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When you apply for DoTS, you will select a preferred stream. You’ll have the flexibility to choose a stream that interests you from business, education or nursing. The stream you choose forms the first year of your course, and determines which Monash course you’ll progress to.Alongside six first-year units in the stream of your choice, you’ll complete two introductory tertiary units. The first unit will introduce you to what it’s like to study at university. The second unit varies depending on your prior studies. If you don’t have the mathematics prerequisites for your desired Monash course, you’ll have the opportunity to gain the required level of mathematics as your second unit. If you already meet the mathematics prerequisites, you’ll take a unit in understanding knowledge and its contexts, which will help you to identify, compare and discuss different approaches to knowledge.On successful completion of DoTS you can receive up to one year of credit towards a range of courses in business, business administration, education or nursing. You’ll have developed skills for tertiary success. Your critical and analytical thinking, and oral and writing skills will be polished and you’ll be ready to take the next step in your higher education path with confidence.In addition to the destination courses, you can apply for entry into other Monash courses through VTAC after successfully completing DoTS. Make sure that you’ve met the prerequisites for your chosen course. Admission into your course will be based on your academic performance and meeting the course prerequisites. All your study is at university level so if you progress to a bachelor’s degree course you’ll be eligible to apply for credit for prior study. The amount of credit granted will be at the discretion of the relevant faculty and will not automatically allow for progression into the second year of your preferred course.Show more",Australia,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
