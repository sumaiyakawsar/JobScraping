Applied Neonatal Physiology,"This is the foundational neonatal unit of study. The purpose of this unit of study is for students to develop greater understanding of normal physiology which will in turn facilitate the development of advanced clinical assessment skills. This is achieved by providing essential grounding in embryological and neonatal development and physiology. Students are guided through the processes involved in fetal to neonatal transition and adaptation. The concepts of oxygenation, thermoregulation and metabolism are discussed in relation to the early neonatal period. These concepts underpin the neonatal clinician’s ability to interpret clinical assessment findings for both term and pre-term infants.","

Assessment of Growth and Development,"The purpose of this unit of study is to build on and consolidate knowledge achieved in the pre-requisite unit of study Applied Neonatal Physiology (071). Students are challenged to consider issues specifically related to assessment, growth and normal development of the neonate. This unit of study is composed of three themes: neonatal assessment, family centred developmental care and, finally, neonatal nutrition.","

Neonatal Special Care,"The purpose of this unit of study is to build on and consolidate knowledge achieved in the pre-requisite unit of study Applied Neonatal Physiology (071). Throughout all sections there is an underlying theme of individualised, family focused developmentally supportive care which is an essential element of contemporary neonatal nursing practice. The ability to stabilise a sick newborn prior to transport as well as provide comfort and support, to families experiencing this crisis is essential for nurses working in level two centres. This unit of study will extend on previous knowledge to include the assessment and clinical management of newborns who require emergency resuscitation and on-going stabilisation for a variety of underlying pathophysiological conditions. Clinical management strategies covered within the unit of study content include modes of respiratory support such as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and High Flow nasal cannula oxygen.","
