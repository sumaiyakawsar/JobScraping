This 5-day course covers the Building Envelope and Mechanical Systems specialities.  What is Passive House? The Passive House Standard is not a regulation, but a methodology and certification system for creating very thermally-efficient buildings. Passive House buildings allow for space heating and cooling-related energy savings of up to 90% compared with typical building stock and over 75% compared to average new builds. Although Passive House buildings have been around internationally for 25 years, at last these super energy-efficient buildings are now appearing in Australia. Passive House buildings show great diversity in aesthetics, size, construction methods and materials. The following five details enable buildings to achieve the Passive House standard:  Exceptionally high levels of thermal insulation Well-insulated window frames with double or triple low-e glazing Thermal bridge-free construction Air-tight building envelope Comfort mechanical ventilation, with highly efficient heat recovery  These principles, together with good orientation, window shading and efficient design comprise a building that is very thermally comfortable and energy efficient. Win work in the emerging Passive House (Passivhaus) building sector There are 152 Certified Passive House Designers and Consultants in Australia and potentially hundreds of clients who want to build to this internationally recognised standard. Growing client demand for high performance, thermally comfortable and energy efficient buildings will provide work for specialist builders and tradespeople. However, there are only 125 certified Passive House Tradespeople in Australia. Consider upskilling, become internationally accredited and improve your marketing edge. Becoming Passive House Accredited The course offers the opportunity to sit the examination which is set by the Passivhaus Institut (Germany) and takes place all round the world on four pre-determined dates per year. On successfully passing the exam, you will receive the internationally recognised accreditation as  Certified Passive House Tradesperson - Building Envelope Specialist or Certified Passive House Tradesperson - Mechanical Services Specialist or both  Certification as a Passive House Tradesperson by the Passive House Institute (PHI), Darnstadt, Germany will only occur on successful completion of the PHI exam which will be held at Box Hill Institute (date to be confirmed).  Additional fees will be charged to sit this exam which also covers 5 years registration with PHI if successful.

When literacy and numeracy skills are under developed, ordinary life in the community can be affected. Together we can break down the barriers to education, training and employment and help participants to become more actively involved in their community.  We make learning the alphabet and numbers fun by applying them to familiar every day activities and situations. Teaching will be based on the interests and personally relevant needs of students to encourage their active involvement in class. By the end of the course, students will be able to recognise basic time, money and measurement, and use simple words and phrases to communicate their ideas and opinions. During their time with us, students will be supported by our friendly literacy and numeracy expert who will engage them with learning strategies that are sensitive to their specific needs.

Learn about Passive House principles and the methodology to create high performance, thermally comfortable and super energy efficient buildings. What is Passive House? Passive House is a design and construction methodology for creating very thermally-efficient buildings. Passive House buildings allow for space heating and cooling-related energy savings of up to 90% compared with typical building stock and over 75% compared to average new builds. Although Passive House buildings have been around internationally for 25 years, at last, these super energy-efficient buildings are now appearing in Australia. Passive House buildings show great diversity in aesthetics, size, construction methods and materials. The following five details enable buildings to achieve the Passive House standard:  exceptionally high levels of thermal insulation well insulated window frames with double or triple low-e glazing thermal bridge free construction air tight building envelope comfort mechanical ventilation, with highly efficient heat recovery  These principles, together with good orientation, window shading and efficient design comprise a building that is very thermally comfortable and energy efficient.
