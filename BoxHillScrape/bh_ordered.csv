This 5-day course covers the Building Envelope and Mechanical Systems specialities.  What is Passive House? The Passive House Standard is not a regulation, but a methodology and certification system for creating very thermally-efficient buildings. Passive House buildings allow for space heating and cooling-related energy savings of up to 90% compared with typical building stock and over 75% compared to average new builds. Although Passive House buildings have been around internationally for 25 years, at last these super energy-efficient buildings are now appearing in Australia. Passive House buildings show great diversity in aesthetics, size, construction methods and materials. The following five details enable buildings to achieve the Passive House standard:  Exceptionally high levels of thermal insulation Well-insulated window frames with double or triple low-e glazing Thermal bridge-free construction Air-tight building envelope Comfort mechanical ventilation, with highly efficient heat recovery  These principles, together with good orientation, window shading and efficient design comprise a building that is very thermally comfortable and energy efficient. Win work in the emerging Passive House (Passivhaus) building sector There are 152 Certified Passive House Designers and Consultants in Australia and potentially hundreds of clients who want to build to this internationally recognised standard. Growing client demand for high performance, thermally comfortable and energy efficient buildings will provide work for specialist builders and tradespeople. However, there are only 125 certified Passive House Tradespeople in Australia. Consider upskilling, become internationally accredited and improve your marketing edge.
