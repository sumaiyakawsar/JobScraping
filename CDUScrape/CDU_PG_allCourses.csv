The Master of Digital Learning Futures can help you get ready for the next wave of global transformation. This innovative, industry-relevant program investigates the dynamics of the digital era. What new 'smarts' are on the horizon and what skills are needed to engage effectively within the digital paradigm? How might we learn next? How might we teach? The Master of Digital Learning Futures is an inter-disciplinary course that probes the possibilities of digital media and how it can optimise learning. The course is suited to those working or aiming to work in educational settings, creative industries, software development, learning design, e-learning and related fields. Based on a solid foundation of core units, you'll have opportunities for research and internships, as well as the flexibility to choose from electives in new media production skills, web development, programming and systems management.","Graduating from this course may lead to a range of roles, including in teaching or as a teaching centre technology officer, instructional designer, education software developer, learning and development specialist or e-learning specialist.",Australia,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,"DLF511 - Hacking the Matrix: Video Games, Cyber Security and the Digital Paradigm","1.             Analyse and discuss a range of theoretical frameworks for understanding our mediated 'reality' and the digital paradigm, and in particular the work of Jean Baudrillard. 2.             Apply the reading of Baudrillard's propositions regarding our mediated reality to the analysis of the Matrix Trilogy to identify the degree of synchronicity between film, fiction, philosophy and fact. 3.             Critically review the value of Baudrillard's theoretical frames for understanding video games, cyber security events in general, and computer hacking in particular. 4.             Critically evaluate the implications of Baudrillard's propositions around digital mediation, simulacra and simulation for the use of digital artifacts in education. 5.             Communicate effectively to present a coherent and independent exposition of knowledge and ideas within and across a range of discipline areas related to the digital paradigm, education and computer hacking.","This unit introduces a range of sociological frames for understanding the digital paradigm, including the work of Jean Baudrillard, particularly his discussion of simulacra and simulation, which informed the Matrix trilogy. The trilogy introduced a virtual world wherein computer hackers worked to free humanity from their enslavement in a digital environment. But surely Baudrillard was not saying that our present-day world is like that presented in the Matrix? With reference to key components of our digital world, such as video games and other sites, students will take up Baudrillard's thesis, and in particular his proposition that computer hacking comprises a cancer-like outcome of a system grounded in digital logics. Students will critically evaluate the validity of Baudrillard's claims with reference to contemporary cyber-security related activities and events, and reflect critically upon the implications of such claims and realities for our use of digital technologies in education.","DLF514 - Digital Technologies: Education, Apps and Mobile Devices","1.             Critically discuss TPACK and other relevant theoretical propositions regarding education, apps, and mobile devices. 2.             Engage in critical reflection to communicate effectively a coherent and independent exposition of knowledge and ideas within and across a range of discipline areas related to the use of apps and mobile devices within education. 3.             Critically appraise the possible range of current resources related to the quality of apps for educational purposes. 4.             Critically identify significant contextual factors as they relate to the use of gestural and other interfaces in education.","This unit provides a strong theoretical framework of the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) model, which covers eight domains of knowledge: technological, pedagogical, content, technological pedagogical, technological content, pedagogical content, technological pedagogical content and the overarching domain of context. Students are required to have access to apps and mobile devices. With reference to key components and knowledge of using apps and mobile devices in education, such as apps, gestural and other interfaces, students will develop an increased understanding of apps and mobile devices in education, to further develop their appraisal skills and knowledge base for better teaching and learning.

Students examine the role, nature and development of knowledge as a social construction across a range of cultures. Through the lens of their own Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander culture, students build 'both-ways' understandings by developing their understandings of Western knowledge systems. Students consider fundamental questions such as: What is knowledge? How do I/we know? What do I/we know? Where/How is knowledge situated? How do I/we enact knowledge? Students consider the relevance of their inquiry into knowledge in terms of their own community, their values, ethics and modern life, including the impact of technologies. Students use the Effective Lifelong Learning Inventory (ELLI) online survey generated in PTS001 to refer to the language of learning and how they are framing their strengths and strategies as they further develop their own learning behaviours as Indigenous learners in a Western higher education context.
