Successful brands such as Google, Apple and Cadbury rely heavily on marketing programs to ensure they stay in front of competitors and in the minds of customers.

It provides techniques that help firms to better understand the needs, preferences and perceptions of their customers (a prerequisite to adding value to them) and ways of using that understanding to focus the value-creating and communicating activities of the firm into areas where they will be most effective.

Customise your degree                           Choose two teaching areas from this list to give you a broad background and to maximise your employment opportunities. If you can’t decide, the best advice is to follow your passion and select senior subjects you enjoyed at school. You can take any combination of two teaching areas, except for the following:  Mathematics and Mathematics Extension two science areas, including Physics, Biology, Chemistry and Earth & Environmental Science.  Biology Biology teachers have the opportunity to appeal to students’ curiosity about nature. You can teach students how the natural world works, and how to grow and protect it. Chemistry Chemistry teachers play a central role in developing students’ scientific literacy as chemistry is the enabling science fundamental to many other scientific disciplines including biotechnology, environmental science, geosciences, materials science and food science. Earth and Environmental Science Earth and environmental science teachers help students to become active citizens who understand that the Earth is an amazing place. You can help them understand the natural processes acting in and upon our planet, and its history, along with providing in-depth knowledge of the mechanisms, natural processes and human impacts that shape environmental systems. English The English teaching area prepares future English teachers to creatively and competently put into practice the knowledge of the English discipline, which covers literature, screen and media studies, and language. As an English teacher you will assist students in becoming multiliterate citizens and creative thinkers, writers, speakers and shapers. Geography Geography fosters students’ sense of wonder, curiosity and respect for places, people, cultures and environments. As a geography teacher you can help students become informed, responsible and active citizens who can contribute to the development of a socially just and environmentally and economically sustainable world. Health and Physical Education Healthy, active living benefits individuals and societies in many ways. As a teacher of health and physical education you have the opportunity to work with students to enhance their own and others’ health, wellbeing and physical activity participation in a range of varied and changing contexts. History Studying history teaches students critical inquiry skills. History teachers lead students to actively investigate the past and ask meaningful questions. You will learn to present sources as evidence and guide students in their investigation, analysis and interpretation of the past so they can become informed citizens. Mathematics Mathematics teachers play a central role in developing students’ essential scientific and numeracy capabilities. Students develop fundamental skills across number and algebra, measurement and geometry, and statistics and probability. Mathematics teachers have the opportunity to prepare students for learning in a range of disciplines and provide them with the skills they will need in their personal life and career. Mathematics Extension Mathematics extension teachers can engage and extend advanced learners to help them develop thorough and rigorous skills, which can be applied to a range of other disciplines. The mathematics extension teaching area assumes sound achievement in Maths Methods or Specialist Maths (or equivalent).  Physics Physics teachers play a central role in developing students’ scientific literacy. Physics deals with the natural laws and processes, and the states and properties of matter, energy, space and time. You will help students to understand physics and the roles it has played in recent advances in information technology, medicine and biotechnology, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics and relativity. Option Units In the final year of the course you can choose two option units in areas that you are interested in.

You can choose from three majors, plus a ""No Major"" option for this course: Biomedical Data Science Biology and medicine are becoming increasingly data-intensive in research and clinical practice. From new sequencing technologies to medical imaging  and electronic health records, to wearable devices recording heart rate, it has never been easier or cheaper to generate biomedical data. Yet these datasets may be large and complex, and the observations noisy. This interdisciplinary major provides the skills you need to 'wrangle' and analyse biomedical data. You will learn statistical and machine learning methods, and use them to identify relationships and gain insight into function and disease states, while gaining some understanding of their limitations and the complexity of the problems which arise.  Computational Data Science The world is awash in data and it's growing at a mammoth pace. Over 2.5 million trillion byes of data are generated every day. In every minute Uber has 45,000 trips; 456,000 tweets are sent; and 3.6 million Google searches occur. NASA alone generates 121 terabytes of data every single day. This major will equip you with the knowledge and skills to bring order to the chaos on terabytes of data and extract meaning. You'll be confident in searching for hidden models, training intelligent systems, creating visualizations, identifying patterns and trends, and discovering solutions and opportunities. You'll undertake data analysis and research across domains, with the focus on the development and application of computational methods which scale as the number of records increases.  Statistical Data Science In this digital and data-rich era the demand for statistical experts is high, yet the pool of such graduates is small. The recent growth of data science has increased the awareness of the importance of statistics, with the analysis of data and interpretation of the results firmly embedded within this newly recognised field. This major provides advanced training in statistics, together with complementary skills in programming and data extraction and mining. This combination gives you the background and experience to gather and evaluate data-based evidence to support informed decision-making, and to advise on the robustness and the uncertainty of the conclusions drawn.

The Earth is an amazing place and for an earth scientist, it offers a unique natural laboratory that covers space and time. Earth science is a multidisciplinary science that applies chemistry, physics, biology and mathematics tools to understand earth processes, decipher its past and predict its future. Earth scientists work to monitor changes in the Earth’s environment and suggest solutions to problems. They study natural hazards to prevent loss of life and reduce property damage. Earth scientists play key roles in the search for fuels and minerals. Climate change, earthquakes and geothermal energy are just a few of the issues that require knowledge of earth science.  Earth science (also known as geoscience) blends the traditional fields of geology, physical geography and oceanography/ hydrology. Geology describes the rocky parts of the Earth’s crust (or lithosphere) and its development. Physical geography, which studies the Earth’s surface, includes geomorphology, soil science and biogeoscience. The marine and freshwater parts of the Earth define the fields of oceanography and hydrology.   ","Exploration Geologist, Geophysicist, Geoscientist, Government Officer, Hydrogeologist, Laboratory Assistant, Mapping Scientist, Marine Scientist, Mine Geologist, Natural Resource Scientist, Project Manager",Australia,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
