While globalisation has the potential to deliver general benefits, the specific interests of these stakeholders can - and do - come into conflict with the interests of business.

A major driver of, and mechanism for, globalisation is business, through trans-border production and consumption of goods and services.  There are also other active stakeholders in globalisation, including governments, regional or international inter-governmental organisations focused on specific interests (e.g. economics, trade, and labour standards), local communities, non-government organisations (NGOs), and unions. The intersecting forces of globalisation can have positive, negative, and, sometimes, entirely unexpected consequences. While globalisation has the potential to deliver general benefits, the specific interests of these stakeholders can - and do - come into conflict with the interests of business.  Because of this, it is critical for managers to understand the context, the stakeholders, the institutions, and the relevant rules and regulations that influence managerial activities in the global environment.",Available,GMBA6002 International Accounting,"Effective accounting Is not simply about the processes of keeping financial records of business transactions.  Accounting practices can also create significant value for a business by ensuring that management decisions are well-informed, and properly directed towards achieving the goals of the business.  Accounting practices are improving with use of new technology, which increases the speed as well as the amount of information available. Accounting processes and information must also meet appropriate professional and international standards for disclosure to shareholders and other stakeholders.  Business cycles are shortening but also, with the increase in cross-national business structures and organisations that come with globalisation, becoming increasingly complex.  In this context, managers must be confident and capable interpreters of accounting information.  In this course, drawing on real examples from around the world, students will gain accounting knowledge to perform in their roles as effective value-creating managers in the global environment.",Available,GMBA6003 Innovation Management and Entrepreneurship,"In the business context, innovation management can be defined as the processes involved in the development of an idea into a new or improved product, service, process, or business model. Entrepreneurship refers to the processes involved in taking the risk to establish or build a business venture in order to make a profit.  To support these two separate but related sets of processes, innovators and entrepreneurs must be able to balance exploration of new ideas with their effective exploitation; carefully evaluate costs and risks as well as potential rewards; design appropriate systems and procedures to support the successful launch of innovations; and communicate the potential value of innovations to a range of critical stakeholders inside and outside the business venture.  In this course, students will learn about the steps in the conception and development of an idea through to its commercialization, and master a range of tools to support this development.",Available,GMBA6004 Leading and Managing People,"Leading and managing people in a globally integrated and interdependent world is complex.  Increasingly, people may live and work across many sites, regions, or countries in their lifetimes. They may work as employees, contractors, consultants; in a single organisation, across a complex supply chain or multi-national organisation; and in many different vocational or professional capacities. Managing this great variety presents challenges.  In this course, students will identify, evaluate and analyse the key leadership and management activities that are central in successfully leading and managing people in modern business environments. Special attention will be paid to the role leadership can play in developing the right skills, generating motivation, and creating the appropriate workplace environment and supportive structures for managing people.",Available,GMBA6005 Twenty First Century Marketing Management,"Marketing is the process whereby business organisations take the goods and services they produce from the development of the initial concept of providing something of value, through to its eventual purchase and use by consumers. With the steady rise in material wealth across the world, and exponential increases in access to timely and specific information, in the twenty-first century consumers have more power than ever to dictate to business organisations the nature of the goods and services they want and need.  Allied with this increase in consumer power is the greatly enhanced scope and scale of marketing channels available to businesses to promote their brands, with the associated increase in competition for consumers’ attention.  To assist in business success, marketing responsibilities are no longer limited to a specific department but require the whole firm to work in an integrated way to achieve its goals. Students will gain knowledge about the stages in the marketing process, and skills to make effective decisions to market products and services in an international context.",Available,GMBA6006 Global Financial Management,"World leaders in government and business frequently refer to the important role of “the global economy”.

A major driver of, and mechanism for, globalisation is business, through trans-border production and consumption of goods and services.  There are also other active stakeholders in globalisation, including governments, regional or international inter-governmental organisations focused on specific interests (e.g. economics, trade, and labour standards), local communities, non-government organisations (NGOs), and unions. The intersecting forces of globalisation can have positive, negative, and, sometimes, entirely unexpected consequences. While globalisation has the potential to deliver general benefits, the specific interests of these stakeholders can - and do - come into conflict with the interests of business.  Because of this, it is critical for managers to understand the context, the stakeholders, the institutions, and the relevant rules and regulations that influence managerial activities in the global environment.",Available,GSBS6004 Organisational Behaviour and Design,"This course explores issues related to organisational structural form, human behaviour and the management of people in organisations.
